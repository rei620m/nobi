### Description
nobi is a python script that runs in the background and reminds me to stretch throughout the day

### Setup
Use Windows Task Scheduler or Cronjobs on Mac Crontab
- Set the script to run at startup or login
- Do not set a recurring schedule because the script itself has looping functionality
